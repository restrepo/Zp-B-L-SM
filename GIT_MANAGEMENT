We depart from the SARAH standard and
will install SARAH Toolbox directly in the primary
directory.

1) We need to explicitly execute the ./configure to have all the sources.
   However note that some of them are disbled:

 $ ./configure --disable-whizard --disable-higgsbounds --disable-higgssignals

2) Symbolic links were removed and real directories were renamed
 $ rm link
 $ mv real_name link

3) YOU NEED TO EXPLICTLY execute make after clone the repo

 $ make

To update to a new version X.X.X  downloaded in the .. dir:

 $ rsync -avxz toolbox-X.X.X/ toolbox

all the old downloaded dirs are removed:

 $ rm -rf calchep/ madgraph/ micromegas/ SARAH/ SPHENO/ SSP/ tarballs/ 

From here, we repeat the steps 1) 2), check status, add possible new files and 
commit with the new version in the message:

 $ git commit -a -m "toolbox X.X.X"
 $ git tag X.X.X COMMIT_HASH
 
 Finally we push into the remote server including the tags:
 
  $ git push origin --tags
